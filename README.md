# SDP-3-Mini

The goal of this project is learn more about and create code on arduino C+. The pourpose of this project beyond learning more on new language is to learn enough so I can complete a project I have been working on; to build a prostetic arm. I have already designed out and will soon begin building the phyisical prostetic. And while I have enough engineering knolage to create the prosthetc, I need to learn more on how to code the servos, and more difficultly code Mioelectric sensors to integrate the prosthetic with the human. I have used arduino in the past so the final deliverable of this ....
